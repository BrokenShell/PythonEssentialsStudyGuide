## Python Basics  
Python Basics refers to the foundational concepts and skills that are necessary for anyone starting to learn the Python programming language. This may involve understanding variables, the different fundamental types in Python, algorithms, input/output, type annotations, built-in functions, working with modules, and using the Python REPL. These concepts form the foundation of programming in Python and are essential for building basic programs and understanding more advanced concepts. Understanding these basics can help programmers to become comfortable with the Python language and start building programs that solve real-world problems.

- Variables: In programming, a variable is a named location in memory where a value can be stored and accessed. In Python, variables are created by assigning a value to a name using the assignment operator (=). The type of a variable is determined by the type of the value it holds.

- Fundamental Types: In Python, there are several built-in types that are used to represent different kinds of data. These types include integers, floating-point numbers, strings, booleans, and others.

- Algorithms Intro: An algorithm is a set of steps or procedures for solving a problem or achieving a goal. In programming, algorithms are often used to perform tasks such as sorting data, searching for specific items, or performing calculations.

- Input & Output: Input/output (I/O) refers to the process of reading from and writing to external sources, such as the keyboard, a file, or a network connection. In Python, the `input` function is used to read input from the user, and the `print` function is used to output data to the console.

- Type Annotations: Type annotations are a feature of Python that allows you to specify the type of a variable or function argument in the form of a type hint. Type annotations are not enforced at runtime, but they can be used by static type checkers and IDEs to help catch type-related errors and improve code readability.

- Builtin Functions: Python has a number of built-in functions that are available to use without the need to import any additional modules. These functions perform a variety of tasks, such as calculating the absolute value of a number, converting a value to a specific type, or searching for a substring in a string.

- Working with Modules: A module is a Python file that contains a collection of related functions, classes, and other code. Modules can be imported and used in other programs to reuse code and avoid duplication. In Python, the `import` statement is used to import a module, and the `from` keyword can be used to import specific elements from a module.

- Python REPL: The Python REPL (read-eval-print loop) is an interactive shell that allows you to enter Python commands and see the results immediately. The REPL is a useful tool for testing code snippets and exploring the Python language.


## Core Python  
Core Python refers to the fundamental concepts and features of the Python programming language. This may involve knowledge of setting up a local environment, working with algorithms, data structures, and classes, as well as understanding component-driven design, class scope, callable objects, dunder methods, built-in iterators, file I/O, and the Python standard library. These skills are essential for anyone looking to become proficient in Python and build robust and scalable applications. Understanding these core concepts can help programmers to write efficient, maintainable, and well-organized code in Python.

- Local Environment Setup: Setting up a local environment refers to the process of configuring a computer to be able to run Python programs. This typically involves installing Python and any necessary libraries or dependencies.

- Algorithms: An algorithm is a set of steps or procedures for solving a problem or achieving a goal. In programming, algorithms are often used to perform tasks such as sorting data, searching for specific items, or performing calculations.

- Data Structures: A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Python has a number of built-in data structures, such as lists, dictionaries, and sets, which can be used to store and manipulate data.

- Intro to Classes: A class is a blueprint for creating objects in object-oriented programming. It defines the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class will have. In Python, classes are defined using the `class` keyword and can be used to create objects that have a specific set of characteristics and behaviors.

- Component Driven Design: Component-driven design is a design pattern that involves dividing a system into smaller, reusable components that can be combined to create larger, more complex systems. In Python, component-driven design can involve creating classes or modules that can be imported and used in other programs.

- Class Scope: Class scope refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables and methods within a class. In Python, class-level variables and methods can be accessed by any object of the class, while instance-level variables and methods can only be accessed by a specific instance of the class.

- Callable Objects: A callable object is an object that can be called (invoked) like a function. In Python, callable objects include functions, methods, and lambda functions.

- Dunder Class Methods (Magic Methods): Dunder (double underscore) methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python that have a specific syntax and are used to implement certain behaviors in classes. For example, the `__init__` method is used to initialize an object when it is created, and the `__str__` method is used to define how an object should be represented as a string.

- Builtin Iterators: An iterator is an object that can be used to iterate (loop) over a sequence of elements, such as a list or a string. Python has several built-in iterators, such as the `for` loop and the `enumerate` function, which can be used to efficiently iterate over sequences of data.

- File I/O: File input/output (I/O) refers to the process of reading from and writing to files on a computer. In Python, the `open` function is used to open a file, and the `close` function is used to close it. The `with` statement can also be used as a context manager to automatically close a file when the block of code within the `with` statement is finished executing.

- Standard Library Overview: The Python standard library is a collection of modules that are distributed with Python and contain a variety of functions and classes for various tasks. An overview of the standard library can help programmers become familiar with the tools and resources that are available to them when developing Python programs.

- Comprehensions: Comprehensions are a concise way to create a list, dictionary, or set in Python by specifying the elements of the collection using a single line of code. They provide a convenient and efficient way to create collections from iterables.

- Building Packages: Building a package in Python refers to the process of creating a library or module that can be imported and used in other programs. Packages are typically structured as a collection of modules and can include additional resources such as data files and documentation. In order to build a package, you typically need to create a `setup.py` file that specifies metadata about the package and lists any dependencies that are required. You can then use tools such as `setuptools` and `twine` to build and distribute the package to other users, who can install it using Python's `pip` package manager. Building packages allows you to share your code with others and encourages code reuse and modularity in your programs.


## Advanced Python  
Advanced Python refers to a deeper understanding of the Python programming language and its advanced features. This may involve knowledge of iterators, generators, decorators, closures, interfaces, protocols, web APIs, exception handling, regular expressions, testing, databases, data manipulation and visualization, and working with libraries. These skills can be useful for building more complex and efficient Python applications, as well as for handling data and integrating with other systems. Knowledge of these advanced concepts can help developers to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code in Python.

- Iterators are objects that can be iterated (looped) upon. An object which returns data, one element at a time when next() is called on it. They are used to represent a stream of data. In Python, an iterator object implements two methods, iter() and next().

- Generators are a special type of function that allows the function to return a value and pause its execution, saving its state for the next time it is called. When a generator function is called, it does not execute the function body immediately, but instead returns a generator object that can be used to execute the function. When the generator object is iterated, it will execute the function body from the last yield statement and return the next value.

- Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of another function. They are used to add additional functionality to an existing function without modifying the function itself. A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument and extends the behavior of the passed function without explicitly modifying its code.

- Closures are inner functions that have access to the variables in the outer (enclosing) function's scope. They are functions that are defined within another function and have access to the variables defined in the outer function. Closures allow inner functions to remember and access the variables in the outer (enclosing) function even after the outer function has finished executing.

- An interface is a collection of related methods with empty bodies. It is a way of specifying what a class must do, but not how it does it. An interface can be thought of as a contract that a class must adhere to. In Python, an interface is defined using the class keyword, but with no implementation of the methods.

- In Python, a protocol is a set of methods that a class must implement in order to be considered a certain type. Protocols are not a language feature in Python, but rather a design pattern used to achieve a similar effect.

- A Web API is an application programming interface for communication over the World Wide Web. It is a set of rules for accessing a web-based software application or web tool. Web APIs allow developers to interact with an application or service over the internet using a set of predefined request and response protocols.

- Exception Handling: This is a crucial aspect of programming in any language and involves handling runtime errors that can occur during the execution of a program.

- Regular Expressions: Regular expressions are a powerful tool for matching and manipulating strings and are commonly used in Python for tasks such as parsing and validation.

- Testing: Testing is an important practice in software development and can help ensure that code is reliable and works as intended. Python has several built-in tools and libraries for testing, such as the `unittest` module and the `pytest` library.

- Databases: Many applications require the ability to store and retrieve data from a database. Python has several libraries for working with various types of databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.

- Data: Python has a number of libraries and tools for working with data, including libraries for data manipulation (such as NumPy and pandas), data visualization (such as Matplotlib and Seaborn), and machine learning (such as scikit-learn).    

- A library is a collection of reusable code that can be imported and used in a variety of different projects. In Python, libraries can be created by writing Python code and packaging it up in a way that can be easily imported and used in other projects. This process involves creating a package, defining the functions and classes in the package, and then building and distributing the package so that it can be used by others.
